# O365-Import
Note: For use with an AD on-prem and O365/Exchnage Hybrid environment. I execute this script with Admin access to
to both Exchange Hybrid Server and ADSync Domain Controller. At the beginning, a window wil pop up to request Office365 credentials but you may have to store a Get-Credential for local PSSessions.

This script is an example for how a small/medium sized company can create and import users into AD and have their email provisioned in Office 365. The following actions are performed:

  1. Users are imported via import_users.csv (firstname, lastname, telephone, alias, is_prem). *** Customizable
  2. Account credentials are generated by their first and last name. *** Customizable
  3. AD user configuration and group settings assigned. *** Customizable
  4. ADSync is performed to Azure/O365.
  5. Provision Premium or Essentials license. *** Can be customized for Enterprise products
  6. Script sleeps until user is visible in O365.
  7. Create mailbox and email alias if alias available.
  8. Close connections
